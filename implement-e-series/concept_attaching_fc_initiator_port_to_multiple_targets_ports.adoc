[.lead]
You can connect an FC initiator port on an ONTAP system to multiple target ports on separate storage arrays within the same family. This configuration is supported with MetroCluster configurations in ONTAP.

ONTAP supports sharing an FC initiator port with multiple target ports in both HA pairs and in stand-alone systems. This configuration is supported for use with all storage arrays listed in the Interoperability Matrix as supported for the release of ONTAP running on your system.

[NOTE]
====
For details about sharing an FC initiator port with multiple target ports and zoning, see the information in the _FlexArray Virtualization Installation Requirements and Reference_

== Single ONTAP FC initiator port connecting to target ports on separate storage arrays

The following example shows an HA pair in which a single ONTAP FC initiator port connects to multiple target ports on different storage arrays:
