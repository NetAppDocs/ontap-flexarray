You can connect ONTAP systems in direct-attached configurations with E-Series storage arrays. You must verify redundancy in connections between the ONTAP systems and the storage arrays to avoid the possibility of a single point of failure. FlexArray Stretch MetroCluster supports direct-attached configurations with E-Series storage arrays. For more information see, the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-stretch/index.html[Stretch MetroCluster installation and configuration].

The Interoperability Matrix contains information about the specific E-Series array models that are supported in direct-attached configurations with ONTAP system.

ONTAP supports the following direct-attached configurations with E-Series storage arrays:

== Stand-alone basic configuration

In a stand-alone basic configuration, two FC initiator ports from the ONTAP system access the ports of a two-port array LUN group.

The following illustration shows a direct-attached configuration where the ONTAP FC initiator ports 0a and 0h access the target ports of a two-port array LUN group:

== Four-port array LUN group

Two FC initiator ports from each ONTAP system in an HA pair access different storage array ports in a four-port array LUN group for redundancy in connections.

The following illustration shows a direct-attached configuration where the ONTAP FC initiator ports access the target ports of a four-port array LUN group.

You can also connect four FC initiator ports from each ONTAP system in the HA pair to two different four-port array LUN groups such that each FC initiator port in a port pair accesses the alternate LUN group.

The following illustration shows a direct-attached configuration where the ONTAP FC initiator ports access the target ports of two four-port array LUN groups:

== Eight-port array LUN group

Four FC initiator ports from each ONTAP system in an HA pair access different storage array ports in an eight-port array LUN group for redundancy in connections.

The following illustration shows a direct-attached configuration where the ONTAP FC initiator ports access the target ports of an eight-port array LUN group:
