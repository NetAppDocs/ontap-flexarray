This configuration contains a single, 4-port LUN group with each target port accessed by a single ONTAP FC initiator port from the HA pair. Due to zoning, only two paths are allowed to a specific array LUN from each of the ONTAP system.

This configuration is supported for use with all storage arrays listed in the Interoperability Matrix as supported for the release of ONTAP running on your system.
