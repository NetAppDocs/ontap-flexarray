summary: "ONTAP does not support mixing some types of storage in aggregates. To help you determine the array LUNs that can be mixed in an aggregate, the storage arrays from each vendor are grouped into families. When you create aggregates, you cannot mix array LUNs from different vendors and from different storage array families in the same aggregate."

ONTAP does not support mixing some types of storage in aggregates. To help you determine the array LUNs that can be mixed in an aggregate, the storage arrays from each vendor are grouped into families. When you create aggregates, you cannot mix array LUNs from different vendors and from different storage array families in the same aggregate.

The following EMC Symmetrix storage array families are supported with ONTAP systems:

* Family 1: VMAX
* Family 2: VMAX3

The Interoperability Matrix is the final authority for information about the storage arrays supported for each vendor.
