Sharing FC initiator ports present on an ONTAP system and initiator ports present on an HP EVA Storage Management Server with common EVA target ports causes compatibility issues.

The compatibility issues result from the different host settings for the FC initiator ports present on an ONTAP system and the EVA Storage Management Server initiator ports.

HP recommends that any HP EVA Storage Management Server that resides in a fabric be configured in a zone that is separate from all operating systems.
