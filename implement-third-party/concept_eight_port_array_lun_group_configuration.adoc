An eight-port LUN group configuration is supported on clustered V-Series systems and on ONTAP systems that can use array LUNs.

This configuration is supported for use with all storage arrays listed in the Interoperability Matrix as supported for the release of ONTAP running on your system.

There are two ways of deploying this configuration: crossed and uncrossed back-end connections.

== Crossed back-end connections

In this configuration with the back-end connections crossed, the FC connections from the same storage array controller go to both fabric switches (redundant).

In this illustration of crossed back-end connections, note how the nodes are attached to the switches and to the storage array. Vs1 uses switch 1 when attaching to the storage array Controller 1 port 1A and Controller 2 port 2C, and uses switch 2 when attaching to storage array Controller 2 ports 2A and Controller 1 port 1C. This optimizes the use of switch ports and array ports, which reduces the impact of a switch or storage array controller failure.

== Back-end connections are not crossed

In this configuration in which the back-end connections are not crossed, the FC connections from the same storage array controller go to only one fabric switch.

The following illustration shows this configuration when the back-end connections are not crossed.
