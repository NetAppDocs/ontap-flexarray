You must consider certain storage array limits when planning for an ONTAP configuration.

The _Hardware Universe_ contains specific limit values for storage arrays and native disks.

The following types of limits apply only to storage arrays and not to native disks:

* Minimum and maximum array LUN size that ONTAP supports
* Minimum size for the array LUN for the root volume
* Spare core array LUN minimum size
* Limits for RAID groups with array LUNs
* Minimum aggregate size for an aggregate of array LUNs
* Maximum number of array LUNs and disks combined, per platform
