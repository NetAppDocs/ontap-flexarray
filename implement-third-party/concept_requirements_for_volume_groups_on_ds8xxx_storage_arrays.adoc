[.lead]
You must be aware of limitations on the number of volume groups that you can use with a LUN group when configuring DS8xxx arrays.

You must use a single volume group for each LUN group on a DS8xxx storage array to guarantee that the DS8xxx array LUNs are consistently presented to all the FC initiators (that are on the ONTAP system) that access them.
[NOTE]
====
If array LUNs are not presented consistently, there is a potential for data corruption.
