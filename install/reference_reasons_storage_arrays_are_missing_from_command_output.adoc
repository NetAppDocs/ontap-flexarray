A storage array that is not connected to the ONTAP system does not appear in the storage array config show output. Problems with cabling, zoning, and host group configuration can prevent a connection between the two devices.

== Resolving the issue

. Check cabling, host group configuration, and zoning as follows:
 ** Check that cables are connected.
 ** Check that the WWPNs for the FC initiators on the ONTAP systems are in the host group.
 ** Check that both the storage array and the FC initiator are in the same zone.
. After the problem is fixed, run storage array config show in ONTAP to confirm that the issue was fixed.
