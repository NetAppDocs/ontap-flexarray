The recommended type of zoning for a configuration with storage arrays is 1:1 zoning. With 1:1 zoning, each zone contains a single FC initiator port and a single storage array target port.

The benefits of creating 1:1 zoning are as follows:

* You limit the number of ports over which a specific array LUN can be accessed.
* There are discovery and boot time improvements because the FC initiators ONTAP systems do not attempt to discover each other.
