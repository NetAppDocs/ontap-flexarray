All FC initiator ports on ONTAP systems are identified by a number and a letter. Labeling differs depending on whether the ports are on the motherboard or cards in expansion slots.

Ports are numbered 0a, 0b, 0c, 0d...

* Port numbering on expansion cards
+
Ports are numbered according to the slot in which the expansion card is installed. A card in slot 3 yields ports 3A and 3B.

The FC initiator ports are labeled 1 and 2. However, the software refers to them as A and B. You see these labels in the user interface and system messages displayed on the console.
