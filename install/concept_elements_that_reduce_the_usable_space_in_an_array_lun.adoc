Several factors impact the usable space in an array LUN. When planning for the required number and size of the array LUNs, you must consider the usable space in the array LUN according to the checksum type you are using, and the elements you might configure.

When calculating the usable space in an array LUN, you must consider the following factors that reduce the usable space of the LUN:

* Space reserved for use by ONTAP
* Space for core dump
* Volume-level Snapshot reserve
* Aggregate-level Snapshot copy
* Checksum type (you assign one type):
 ** Block checksum (BCS)
 ** Advanced Zoned checksum (AZCS)
