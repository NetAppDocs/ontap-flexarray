ONTAP monitors a link's usage periodically. The ONTAP response to a link failure differs depending on where the failure occurs.

The following table shows what occurs if there is a failure in a fabric-attached configuration:

[options="header"]
|===
| If a failure occurs in the link between the...| Then...
a|
ONTAP system and the switch
a|
ONTAP receives notification immediately and sends traffic to the other path immediately.
a|
Switch and the storage array
a|
ONTAP is not immediately aware that there is a link failure because the link is still established between the ONTAP system and the switch. ONTAP becomes aware that there is a failure when the I/O times out. ONTAP retries three times to send the traffic on the original path, then it fails over the traffic to the other path.
