Zoning enables a storage administrator to restrict the array LUNs that a particular ONTAP system can access. ONTAP requires that an array LUN be visible on only one target port for each initiator port.

Configuring zoning on a Fibre Channel (FC) switch enables you to define paths between connected nodes, restricting visibility and connectivity between devices connected to a common FC SAN.
