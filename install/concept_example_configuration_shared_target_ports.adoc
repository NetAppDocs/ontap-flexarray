A maximum of two ONTAP FC initiator ports can be connected to a single target port on the storage array.

The best practice for zoning is to have each FC initiator-target port pair in a separate zone (1:1).

== Shared target port attached to multiple initiator ports

The following illustration shows connections and zoning for sharing a target port with multiple FC initiator ports on different ONTAP systems.

The solid lines in the following illustration show the connections from the FC initiator ports on system vs1 and the dashed lines show the connections from the FC initiator ports on system vs2.

The following table shows the 1:1 zoning definitions for the example of one target port sharing two FC initiator ports from controllers in an HA pair:
