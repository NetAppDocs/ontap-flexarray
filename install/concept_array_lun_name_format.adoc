[.lead]
The name assigned to an array LUN has a new format to ensure that the name is unique across a cluster.

The array LUN name consists of two components and looks like the following:

``<array_prefix>.<offset>``, for example `EMC-1.1`.

* The `array_prefix` is a unique prefix that ONTAP assigns by default to each storage array.
+
This field is composed of ``<array_name-array_instance> (EMC-1`` in this case).
+
`array_name` can be denoted by the first three letters of the name of the vendor.
+
If there is more than one array from the same vendor, the value of `array_instance` proceeds in an ascending order.

* The offset is the ascending virtual disk number that ONTAP assigns to each LUN. It is independent of the LUN ID of the host.

You can modify the ``<array_prefix>`` field by using the `storage array modify -name -prefix` command.
