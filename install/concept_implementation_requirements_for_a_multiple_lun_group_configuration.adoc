You can improve the system performance by implementing a multiple LUN group configuration in your storage environment. Certain setup tasks must be performed on the ONTAP systems and the storage arrays for implementing this configuration.

A multiple LUN group configuration is supported for most storage arrays. See the _Interoperability Matrix_ to confirm that this configuration is supported with your particular storage array.

You must work with the storage array administrator to set up the following on the _storage array_ for a multiple LUN group configuration:

* Use as many ports as possible, to provide access to the array LUNs allocated for the ONTAP system.
* Use host groups (or your vendor's equivalent) to define which array LUN groups are presented to each FC initiator port on an ONTAP system.

You can set up the following on the ONTAP system to implement a multiple LUN group configuration:

* Use one FC initiator port pair for each array LUN group.
+
Each FC initiator port pair accesses a different LUN group on the storage array through redundant paths.

* Create a large aggregate in the ONTAP configuration, and add array LUNs from multiple RAID groups (parity groups) to the aggregate.
+
By doing so, the I/O is spread across more disks. The combination of spreading I/O across the RAID groups and creating one large aggregate results in a significant performance boost.

You must set up the following on the _switch_ to implement a multiple LUN group configuration:

* Configure switch zoning to define which target ports the FC initiator ports on the ONTAP system should use to access each array LUN group.
